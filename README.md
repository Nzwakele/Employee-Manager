# Employee-Manager
The program must determine if the person is an employee or a manager.

While you can assign values to variables as you declare them, programs typically
become more valuable when a user can supply different values for variables each time
a program executes. This is a program that allows the user to input name, age, and
salary and output the entered data as follows:

EMPLOYEE
Name: Jake
Age: 35
Salary: 15000

NB. The program must determine if the person is an employee or a manager.

The person is an employee if they earn less than 20 000. If they earn more than 20
000, the person is the manager.
